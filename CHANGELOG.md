## [0.2.0] - 2025-12-06

### <u>refactor:</u>

- Refactored dark mode implementation to use Tailwind CSS v4 `dark:` variants instead of Context-based conditional styling
- Refactored `ThemeContext.jsx` to properly memoize context value with `useMemo()` for performance optimization
- Refactored `App.jsx` to remove `useTheme()` dependency and use CSS `dark:` classes
- Refactored `Hero.jsx` to eliminate Context consumption for styling (6 dark mode conditional blocks removed)
- Refactored `Header.jsx` to use pure CSS `dark:` variants for background and border colors
- Refactored `Footer.jsx` to remove `useTheme()` and adopt `dark:` utility classes
- Refactored `LogoTradimedika.jsx` to use CSS-only dark mode styling
- Refactored `LeafFall.jsx` to remove Context dependency for leaf color changes
- Refactored `SymptomsSelector.jsx` to use `dark:` variants for all interactive states (input, dropdown, hover)

### <u>add:</u>

- Added `@custom-variant dark (&:where(.dark, .dark *))` directive in `src/index.css` for Tailwind v4 dark mode support
- Added `html.dark body` CSS rule for dark mode background color
- Added proper destructuring of `useDarkMode()` values in `ThemeProvider` for memoization stability

### <u>optimization:</u>

- Optimized React re-renders: reduced from 10 components to 1 component (`DarkModeToggle`) when toggling dark mode
- Optimized Context API usage: only `DarkModeToggle.jsx` now consumes `useTheme()` for toggle logic
- Achieved 90% reduction in JavaScript re-renders on theme change (styles update via CSS only)
- Improved memoization strategy in `ThemeContext` by using individual dependencies instead of object reference

### <u>standardization:</u>

- Standardized dark mode implementation across all components using Tailwind CSS v4 best practices
- Aligned with React.dev guidelines: "Even when a component is memoized, it will still re-render when a context that it's using changes"
- Established CSS-first approach for theming: Context for logic, CSS for styling
- Unified dark mode class names following Tailwind v4 `dark:` convention

### <u>fix:</u>

- Fixed `useMemo()` implementation in `ThemeContext.jsx` by destructuring `useDarkMode()` values before memoization
- Fixed Tailwind v4 dark mode not working due to missing `@custom-variant` directive
- Fixed unnecessary re-renders caused by non-memoized Context value objects

### <u>update:</u>

- Updated `src/index.css` to include Tailwind v4 dark mode configuration with `@custom-variant`
- Updated all component styling to use `dark:` variants: `dark:bg-dark`, `dark:text-light`, `dark:border-light/60`
- Updated `ThemeProvider` to create stable memoized context value object

### <u>refactor:</u>

### <u>optimization:</u>

- Optimized dropdown rendering with max 10 results limit

### <u>update:</u>

- Updated Hero component to integrate SymptomsSelector with multi-selection capability
- Improved UX with real-time filtering, keyboard navigation, and visual feedback
