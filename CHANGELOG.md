# Change Log

## [0.3.3] - 2025-12-09

### <u>add:</u>

- Added `normalizeForMatching()` function in `src/utils/normalizeSymptom.js` for accent-insensitive matching
- Added `validate-symptoms.js` script for validating JSON data consistency and structure
- Added support for French special characters (œ, apostrophes) in validation patterns

### <u>update:</u>

- Updated `src/utils/normalizeSymptom.js` to preserve French accents in symptom display (é, è, à, ô, etc.)
- Updated `src/hooks/useSymptomTags.js` to use flexible duplicate detection (accent-insensitive)
- Updated `src/components/input/SymptomsSelector.jsx` with accent-insensitive filtering for better UX
- Updated `src/utils/remedyMatcher.js` to support flexible matching (accepts "diarrhee" OR "diarrhée")
- Updated `scripts/validateData.js` validation rules to accept French accents instead of rejecting them
- Updated `src/data/db.json` with 14 verified remedies (reduced from 101) with proper French accents
- Updated `src/data/symptomList.json` to 23 symptoms with correct French spelling (accents preserved)
- Updated `src/data/synonymsSymptomList.json` with 19 synonym mappings and proper accent usage
- Updated `validate-symptoms.js` to use ES module imports instead of CommonJS `require()`

### <u>refactor:</u>

- Refactored normalization system from "remove accents" to "preserve accents with flexible matching"
- Refactored symptom matching logic to compare normalized versions while displaying original text
- Simplified synonym validation to unidirectional structure (removed bidirectional requirement)

### <u>delete:</u>

- Deleted `scripts/normalizeData.js` migration script (no longer needed with new accent-preserving strategy)

### <u>fix:</u>

- Fixed symptom matching failures caused by accent mismatches between user input and database
- Fixed validation script rejecting valid French characters (œ in "œdème", apostrophes in "manque d'énergie")
- Fixed inconsistent accent usage in `db.json` (glycemie → glycémie, diarrhee → diarrhée, nausee → nausée, anxiete → anxiété)
- Fixed "haut-le-cœur" containing hyphen (normalized to "haut le cœur")

### <u>standardization:</u>

- Standardized French orthography across all JSON files with proper accent usage
- Established dual normalization pattern: `normalizeSymptom()` for display, `normalizeForMatching()` for comparison
- Unified validation rules to accept French special characters (à, â, ä, é, è, ê, ë, ï, î, ô, ù, û, ü, ÿ, ç, œ, ')

### <u>optimization:</u>

- Optimized database size: reduced `db.json` from 2266 lines to 599 lines (~73% reduction)
- Improved user experience with flexible search (users don't need to type accents correctly)
- Enhanced data quality with scientifically verified information for 14 core remedies

### <u>features:</u>

- **Flexible Accent Matching**: Users can search "diarrhee" or "diarrhée" - both work perfectly
- **Proper French Display**: All symptoms display with correct French spelling and accents
- **Enhanced Validation**: Comprehensive validation scripts ensuring data consistency
- **Streamlined Database**: Focused, high-quality dataset with verified natural remedies

---

## [0.3.2] - 2025-12-07

### <u>fix:</u>

- Fixed results display behavior to persist across multiple searches instead of disappearing after 2 seconds
- Fixed button state to show "Recherche effectuée" feedback for 2 seconds while keeping results visible

### <u>update:</u>

- Updated `useSymptomSubmit.js` to maintain `hasSubmitted` state with 2-second delay for button feedback only
- Updated `Hero.jsx` results display to use `results !== null` instead of `hasSubmitted` for persistent visibility
- Updated UX flow: button resets to "Découvrir nos solutions" after 2 seconds while results remain displayed

### <u>optimization:</u>

- Optimized user experience by decoupling button state from results visibility
- Improved results persistence: subsequent searches update the count without hiding the results panel

---

### <u>update:</u>

- Updated all symptoms in `symptomList.json` (31 symptoms) to normalized format (removed accents: "immunité" → "immunite", "cholestérol" → "cholesterol", etc.)
- Updated all symptoms in `db.json` (101 remedies) to match normalized format
- Updated `synonymsSymptomList.json` to use normalized symptom keys and values

- Updated SymptomsSection to integrate both symptom selection and submission logic in one cohesive component

### <u>refactor:</u>

- Refactored Hero component to remove redundant CTA button (now integrated in SymptomsSection)
- Refactored SymptomsSection as pure component depending only on internal hooks (composition pattern)
- Refactored symptom matching to use pre-normalized data for optimal performance (no runtime normalization overhead)
- Simplified ESLint configuration to use only installed packages (removed missing dependencies)

### <u>delete:</u>

- Deleted duplicate symptom "maux de tête" (merged with "mal de tête" → normalized as "mal de tete")
- Removed old placeholder `handleSearch()` function from Hero component
- Removed standalone CTA button (replaced by integrated submission button in SymptomsSection)

- Unified loading animation duration across components (300-500ms)

### <u>optimization:</u>

- Optimized symptom matching by normalizing data once at build time instead of runtime

- Optimized data structure: deduplicated symptomList from 32 to 31 unique symptoms

### <u>features:</u>

- **Symptom Submission System**: Complete workflow from selection to remedy matching with visual feedback
- **Relevance Scoring**: Remedies sorted by number of matching symptoms, then alphabetically
- **Loading States**: Professional UX with spinner, disabled states, and success animations

## [0.2.0] - 2025-12-06

### <u>refactor:</u>

- Refactored dark mode implementation to use Tailwind CSS v4 `dark:` variants instead of Context-based conditional styling

- Improved memoization strategy in `ThemeContext` by using individual dependencies instead of object reference

### <u>standardization:</u>
